			<header><h1>Old ends, new beginnings: recapping the past four years, and looking forward to what’s next</h1></header>

			</p><p>Last Friday, at 10:00am, I hit submit on my last final exam of the summer term, 
				and was officially done with my undergraduate education, something I still haven’t fully processed. 
				As I prepare to step away from the campus of UMich, I can’t help but reflect on everything that’s taken place
				 over the past four years. Between a Final Four appearance for the men’s basketball team, a College World Series 
				 appearance from our baseball team and, most recently, a national title for the women’s gymnastics team, it really 
				 has been great to be a Michigan Wolverine in recent years (we can ignore the football team’s struggles, for now). 
				 More importantly, I am grateful for all the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired throughout my studies, 
				 and I can’t wait to put them to use as I begin my professional journey.</p>
			<p></p><p>About 18 months ago, I thought I had everything figured out for my remaining semesters at school. Back then, I was only majoring in statistics, and was just a few electives away from being ready to graduate. I was setting myself up for a career as a data analyst, and I was really enjoying what I learned in my major electives, especially my Data Mining and Computational Methods in Data Science classes. After realizing the importance of having a solid computing background in the world of modern statistics, I decided to declare a minor in computer science, to strengthen my programming abilities. </p><p id="5671431e-8117-41e1-b109-ca9df525e7e4" class="">
			</p>
			<p>After taking the introductory programming classes, however, I discovered I had a passion for coding. 
				I was content with what I had learned, but I wanted to go deeper. Suddenly, I was faced with a choice: 
				do I continue with my current path and settle for a minor, or do I change things up and upgrade to a second major? 
				To accomplish the latter, I would need to take many more classes, and postpone my expected graduation date. Ultimately, 
				I was willing to accept those conditions, and I declared the major in computer science, a decision I 
				am very glad to have made. </p><p>
			</p><p>
			</p><p>After two straight years of summer classes, and packing the majority of my semesters with programming courses, 
				I am very excited to apply everything I've learned with my two degrees into the real world.
