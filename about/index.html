            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div id="about-me-page">
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of Michigan in August 2021 with Bachelor of Science degrees in Statistics and Computer Science.
                    My passion for data analysis originated from witnessing its applications in the sports world,
                    which led me to explore how sound quantitative analysis can guide well-informed decisions 
                    across all aspects of life, while strengthening our understanding of the world around us.
                    As a native of the northwest Chicago suburbs, I grew up a fan of the Bears and the Cubs.

                <p>
                    A desire to widen my analytical toolkit, mixed with a curiousity for computer technologies,
                    drove me deeper into the world of computing.
                    I have a great appreciation for how carefully-designed tools can improve the lives of many, and I am constantly
                    thinking of ways to apply/grow my skillset to solve important problems. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you will likely find me going for a run or reading a book.
